## National reporting platform - SDG

The national reporting platform - SDG (SDG - NRP) is a publicly available tool serving the dissemination and presentation of data for Germany on  the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda by the United Nations (UN).

### Our approach to NRP

In order to conform with the UNâ€™s Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, the minimum characteristics an SDG NRP should have are that it should: <br>
- be managed by national statistical offices;
- features official statistics and metadata according to established standard methodology;
- be publicly accessible;
- allows for feedback from data users;
- features open source (free) technology.

In addition, the German SDG-NRP has been developed in accordance with recognized international guidelines, especially with regard to open data and software.

## NRP - sources

The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) actively supports the development of national reporting platforms, in particular as an open source solution for the presentation of SDG indicators. Precursors in this field are the USA and Great Britain. The current version of the German reporting platform has been developed based on an earlier version of the UK NRP, and adapted to the needs of German statistics. The project code is publicly available in a [Github repository](https://github.com/G205SDGs/sdg-indicators).

The new universal version of the open-SDG platform developed by the US, UK and Center for Open Data Enterprise is available. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the national US and UK platforms for SDGs and the [Open SDG project documentation](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which includes technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running.

## NRP - applied technology

### Back-end IT requirements:
- GitHub: hosting website designed for programming projects using the Git version control system.
- Jekyll: generator of static pages written in Ruby

### Front-end IT requirements:
- XHTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Chartist: JavaScript library that offers customizable and responsive charts
- Bootstrap: framework CSS

## Current display

Due to technical difficulties, the current version of the German NRP contains some faulty illustrations, which are referred to here:<br>
- Integers are displayed without decimal places (even in time series in which other numerical values with decimal places exist).
- Very long names of time series are not broken up into several lines in the axis labels of the graphics and hence are partly cut off.
