Sustainable action - that is, the equal inclusion of social, economic and ecological aspects in all decisions - is more important than ever. It is precisely times of upheaval that open up the opportunity for active shaping and thus for lasting change. Shaping these processes in such a way that they secure our future viability in the long term
is only possible for the German government if it has valid information about where we stand on the path to a sustainable society and in which direction we are moving.

The Federal Statistical Office has been fulfilling this task since 2006 with the publication of its indicator reports. The reports, which are published every two years, include the indicators for measuring the achievement of the goals of the German Sustainability Strategy.

The "Data on the Indicator report", which have been published in parallel since 2008, provide further information in a thematic context to the actual indicators. These are intended to help place the development of an indicator in a context and analyze its development.
