The Federal Government revised the Sustainable Development Strategy substantially in 2016 in the context of implementing the
2030 Agenda goals at the national level. The strategy has been regularly updated ever since. In its Indicator Report published
every two years, the Federal Statistical Office provides detailed information on the development of the national sustainability
indicators set up to measure progress towards achieving the goals of the German Sustainable Development Strategy.
The reports contain detailed descriptions of all indicators, their development and status and include further analysis.

Since February 2020 the Federal Statistical Office has also provided access to the indicators of the German Sustainable
Development Strategy on this online platform on sustainable development. Here current statistical data and metadata regarding
Germany's sustainable development are available in a processed form and an interactive environment. This allows a vivid
illustration of the development of the indicators and the progress made towards achieving the goals over time.
