The target values to be achieved as part of the German Sustainable Development Strategy, the indicators,
their data bases and calculations as well as the graphical representations have been decided by the
Federal Government. The Federal Statistical Office was also involved in an advisory capacity. The structure
of the German Sustainable Development Strategy and the selection of indicators are based on the United
Nations 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Accordingly, at least one indicator
for each of the 17 goals was included in the German Sustainable goals was included in the German Sustainable
Development Strategy.

Since 2006, the Federal Statistical Office has been tasked with supporting the measurement of national
indicators with its own data from official statistics and coordinating the integration of data from other
authorities. For this reason, in addition to the Sustainable Development Strategy indicators now published on this
online platform, the Federal Statistical Office publishes an indicator report for the German Sustainable
Development Strategy every two years (most recently in 2022).
