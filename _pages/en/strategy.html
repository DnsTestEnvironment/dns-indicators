With the Agenda 2021, each of the 178 signatory states declared its willingness to implement the guiding principle

it has been based on the 2030 Agenda and is referred to as the German Sustainable Development Strategy (DNS).
It is the strategic implementation of the 2030 Agenda at national level.
At the same time, the Federal Government sets its own political priorities in the DNS within the framework of
the global goals. The Federal Government expresses these priorities through sustainability postulates below
the 17 goals, defines national indicators to measure them and sets specific target values and years to be achieved.

Sustainable Development.
