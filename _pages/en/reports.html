    <p style="padding-bottom: 70px;">On January 11, 2017, the German Federal Cabinet approved the new edition of the German Sustainable Development
      Strategy. This revision represents the most comprehensive further development of the strategy since its conception in 2002 and is in line with
      the United Nations' 2030 Agenda. In this context, the new edition is the essential framework for the national implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its
      17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Federal Statistical Office has been commissioned by the German government to analyze and monitor the
      Sustainable Development Strategy since 2006. It produces the indicators that measure the achievement of the goals in the individual thematic areas and
      publishes so-called indicator reports every two years.

    Feasibility study on the presentation of the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy by federal states (only available in German)
    In addition to the federal government, the majority of the German states have their own Sustainable Development Strategies. Some state governments have
    already aligned these with the 17 global sustainable development goals of the 2030 Agenda; in other states, there are efforts to adapt or develop a
    state-specific Sustainable Development Strategy.
    <br><br>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 100px;">The heads of the state and senate chancelleries of the Federation and the Länder (CdS) have decided to develop uniform indicators and evaluation
    standards for the Federal Government and the Länder for monitoring the success of the DNS. The Federal Statistical Office was asked by the Bund
    Länder Erfahrungsaustausch Nachhaltigkeit (BLE NH) - a body of the federal and state departments responsible for sustainability - to provide an
    overview for presenting the indicators of the DNS by federal state. The feasibility study presented here corresponds to the advanced overview.
