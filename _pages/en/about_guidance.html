<h3>Open source project on GitHub</h3>

The DNS online platform is a publicly accessible tool for the dissemination and presentation of German data for the indicators of the German
Sustainable Development Strategy.

<h3>Sources</h3>

The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) actively supports the development of national online platforms, in particular as open source solutions
for the presentation of DNS indicators. Pioneers in this area are the USA and Great Britain. The current version of the German online platform was
developed on the basis of an earlier version of the British online platform and adapted to the needs of German statistics.
The project code for the DNS online platform is publicly available in the
<a href="https://github.com/sustainabledevelopment-deutschland/sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io" target="_blanc" onclick="return confirm_alert('GitHub', 'En');">Github repository</a>.
<br><br>
A universal version of the codes for an online platform developed by the United States, Great Britain and the Center for Open Data Enterprise is
available. The SDG online platform is based on this. If you are interested, we recommend that you familiarise yourself with the SDG online
platforms of the United States and Great Britain and the relevant <a href="https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blanc" onclick="return confirm_alert('open-sdg', 'En');">Open SDG project documentation</a>).
