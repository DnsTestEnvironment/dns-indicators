The Federal Statistical Office is responsible for monitoring the national sustainability indicators
and reporting on their statements and developments. To this end, the Federal Statistical Office publishes
<a href="https://dns-indicators.de/strategy/publications/">indicator reports</a> and has been
operating an <a href="https://dns-indicators.de/">online platform</a> under its own technical
responsibility since February 2020.
<br><br>
While the online platform is continuously updated to reflect the latest developments in the indicators,
the indicators are reviewed every two years by the Federal Statistical Office in indicator reports
to determine the status of target achievement. In doing so, it carries out a trend evaluation and
formulates an assessment of whether or not the targets are being achieved according to the current
state of development. The Federal Statistical Office thus also provides information on the status of
sustainable development in Germany between the progress reports published by the Federal Government
every four years. Even though the goals and associated indicators of the DNS have been defined
politically, their presentation in the indicator reports is based on the statistical principles of
professional independence, objectivity and neutrality. Professional independence is also important
to the Federal Government and is guaranteed by the Federal Government in the cabinet resolution on
the 2016 DNS of 11 January 2017.
