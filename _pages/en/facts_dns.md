The target values to be achieved within the framework of the German Sustainability Strategy, the indicators, their data basis and calculations as well as the graphical representations have been agreed by the Federal Government. The Federal Statistical Office was part of the process in a consultative role. The structure of the German Sustainability Strategy and the selection of indicators are based on the United Nations' [2030 Agenda](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/facts_agenda/) and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Accordingly, at least one indicator for each of the 17 goals has been included in the German Sustainability Strategy in a thematically corresponding way.

Since 2006, the Federal Statistical Office has been responsible for measuring the national indicators in a professionally independent process using its own data from official statistics and for coordinating the integration of data from other agencies. For this reason, in addition to the Sustainability Strategy indicators now published on the online platform, the Federal Statistical Office publishes an [indicator report](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Society-Environment/Sustainable-Development-Indicators/_node.html#sprg355414) for the German Sustainability Strategy every two years (most recently in 2021).
