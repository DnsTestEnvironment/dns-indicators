The online platform comprises two components, namely the indicator set of the [German Sustainable Development Strategy](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/issues/sustainability/) (Deutsche Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie, DNS) and the German set of indicators for the global sustainability goals ([Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/)) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. Since the German Sustainable Development Strategy is aimed at implementing the 2030 Agenda at the national level, indicators shared by both strategies are linked to each other on the platform.

The time series of the indicators of both online platforms are available for download.

A direct link to the homepage of the SDG online platform can be found at the top right of this page next to the search field.

Both sets of indicators are structured according to the 17 goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. Accordingly, the icons and the colours chosen for the 17 goals (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) which are used here and on the SDG online platform correspond to those of the United Nations. The icons are protected by copyright.

## Aim and background

The target values to be achieved within the framework of the German Sustainability Strategy, the indicators, their data basis and calculations as well as the graphical representations have been agreed by the Federal Government. The Federal Statistical Office was part of the process in a consultative role. The structure of the German Sustainability Strategy and the selection of indicators are based on the United Nations' [2030 Agenda](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/facts_agenda/) and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Accordingly, at least one indicator for each of the 17 goals has been included in the German Sustainability Strategy in a thematically corresponding way.

Since 2006, the Federal Statistical Office has been responsible for measuring the national indicators in a professionally independent process using its own data from official statistics and for coordinating the integration of data from other agencies. For this reason, in addition to the Sustainability Strategy indicators now published on the online platform, the Federal Statistical Office publishes an [indicator report](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Society-Environment/Sustainable-Development-Indicators/_node.html#sprg355414) for the German Sustainability Strategy every two years (most recently in 2021).


## Structure of the reporting platform

The platform is organised in goals, indicator fields and postulates, and their respective indicators (Fig. 1). Every four years the Federal Government reviews the strategy and its indicators. The strategy is modified if required, and indicators are i.e. replaced or new ones added.

Each indicator of the DNS is presented individually or together with a closely related indicator on an own page. A chart visualizes the development of the indicator as well as - if possible - the goal to be reached. The definitions and intentions as well as the development of the indicators are explained. The information stem from the biennial published [indicator report](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Nachhaltigkeitsindikatoren/Publikationen/Downloads-Nachhaltigkeit/indicator-report-0230002189004.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) of the Federal Statistical Office.

For some indicators the data are displayed at Federal States level. However, the goal shown stays the goal for Germany. Most of the Federal States of Germany have own sustainability strategies and indicators. They are not displayed the DNS platform. [Here](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Society-Environment/Sustainable-Development-Indicators/German/SubstainableDevelopmentIndicatorsLaender.html) you can find a compilation of sustainability strategies of the Federal States of Germany (also called “Länder”).

The symbols and choice of colour of the 17 goals (Fig. 1 and 2) which are used here and on the SDG-part of this reporting platform are copyright protected by the United Nations.

## Indicator evaluation

Weather symbols illustrate in an easy-to-understand way – from sunshine to thunderstorm (Fig. 4) - the course of development of most indicators. An explanation of the definition of the symbols is found [here](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status/). Weather symbols of the last four years can be found behind the button “indicator status summary” on each respective indicator page. A rough estimation about how stable the development was is possible by using the weather symbols. However, the symbols cannot replace the explanatory texts with their background information.

On the top of the DNS page there is a button “evaluation”. If you choose in the following drop-down menu “summary”, the [whole development of the weather symbols of all indicators over time](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/status_summary/) is shown.

## Comparison of DNS and SDG indicators

The United Nations SDG indicators and their numbering are not identical to the DNS indicators. If an SDG indicator is comparable to a DNS indicator, this is indicated by a button with a direct link to the respective indicator (Fig. 4).

## Technical background

To present the data for each participating country in a formatted form, the open source project Open SDG offers a standardised template of an online platform on GitHub. More information can be found here: [Technical instructions](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/guidance/).
