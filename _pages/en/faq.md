## How do I suggest new or different data sources?
If you have feedback on the data sources we have used or have suggestions for new data sources then please contact us at: <a href="mailto:{{site.email_contacts.questions}}">{{site.email_contacts.questions}}</a>.

## What does disaggregation mean?
Disaggregation is used to break an existing indicator down into subcategories for closer examination. The best known are age or sex. However, the disaggregations used differ from indicator to indicator and are referenced in the indicator name or defined by the international organisation responsible for the indicator.

## What are you doing to fill data gaps?
If no data are available for an indicator, we need to look for possible data sources and check them for quality. If the quality meets our requirements, the data will be included in the SDG online platform.

For some indicators data are available at the national level, but the underlying data sources do not allow disaggregation by all required categories.

This makes it necessary to look for new data sources, link existing sources or model data. The relevant units at the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) are continuously involved in this process.

## Can other countries copy this website?
Yes. The website can be freely used by other countries to create their own online platform. The terms and conditions for using GitHub apply. For more information, please see [Technical instructions](https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/en/guidance/).
