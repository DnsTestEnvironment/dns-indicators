Since 2002 Germany has had a national Sustainability Strategy with its own goals, indicator reports and postulates. In 2017 this strategy was revised to align it with the United Nations [2030 Agenda](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/agenda/) and the associated 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) and is now called the [German Sustainable Development Strategy](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/issues/sustainability) (Deutsche Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie - DNS). In the process of revising the strategy, at least one indicator was included for each of the 17 goals in line with the 2030 Agenda themes. The target values, indicators, data bases and calculations were adopted by the Federal Government.

On behalf of the Federal Government, the Federal Statistical Office has published a report on progress towards achieving the goals of the German Sustainable Development Strategy every two years since 2006. The [indicator report](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Nachhaltigkeitsindikatoren/Publikationen/Downloads-Nachhaltigkeit/indicator-report-0230002189004.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) is provided in the form of a bound publication and as a PDF file. Since 2020 the development of the DNS indicators has additionally been published on this online platform.
