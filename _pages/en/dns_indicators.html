The target values to be achieved within the framework of the German Sustainable Development Strategy, the indicators,
their data basis and calculations as well as the graphical representations have been decided by the Federal
Government. The Federal Statistical Office was also involved in an advisory capacity. The structure of the
German Sustainable Development Strategy and the selection of indicators are based on the United Nations' 2030 Agenda
and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Accordingly, at least one indicator for each of the 17 goals
has been included in the German Sustainable Development Strategy in a thematically appropriate way.

Since 2006, the Federal Statistical Office has been responsible for independently supporting the measurement
of national indicators with its own data from official statistics and for coordinating the integration of data
from other authorities. For this reason, in addition to the Sustainable Development Strategy indicators now published
on this online platform, the Federal Statistical Office publishes an indicator report for the German
Sustainable Development Strategy every two years (most recently in 2022).
