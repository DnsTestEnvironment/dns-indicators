<br><br>On January 11, 2017, the German Federal Cabinet approved the new edition of the German Sustainability Strategy. This revision represents the most comprehensive further development of the strategy since its conception in 2002 and is in line with the United Nations' 2030 Agenda. In this context, the new edition is the essential framework for the national implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Federal Statistical Office has been commissioned by the German government to analyze and monitor the sustainability strategy since 2006. It produces the indicators that measure the achievement of the goals in the individual thematic areas and publishes so-called indicator reports every two years.

Some state governments have already aligned these with the 17 global sustainability goals of the 2030 Agenda; in other states, there are efforts to adapt or develop a state-specific sustainability strategy.
<br><br>
The heads of the state and senate chancelleries of the Federation and the Länder (CdS) have decided to develop uniform indicators and evaluation standards for the Federal Government and the Länder for monitoring the success of the DNS. The Federal Statistical Office was asked by the Bund Länder Erfahrungsaustausch Nachhaltigkeit (BLE NH) - a body of the federal and state departments responsible for sustainability - to provide an overview for presenting the indicators of the DNS by federal state. The feasibility study presented here corresponds to the advanced overview.
