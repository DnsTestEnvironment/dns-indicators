  From the fight against hunger and poverty to affordable and clean energy to climate protection or the goal of livable,
  sustainable cities: As part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the 193 member states of the United Nations
  have defined 17 global goals for sustainable development.
  <br><br>
  Since 2016, the German sustainability strategy has also been based on these 17 global goals.
  On March 10, 2021, the German Federal Cabinet agreed on the further development of the
