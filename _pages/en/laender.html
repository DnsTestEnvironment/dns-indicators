    <p>In addition to the Federal Government, the majority of the Länder have their own strategy for sustainable development.
      Some Länder governments have aligned their strategies with the Global Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda,
      while efforts are being made by other Länder to adjust or draw up their own sustainable development strategy. Please note that most of the
      linked documents and webpages are available in German only.

          39 indicators, the Sustainable development Strategy focuses on central sustainabillity topics which are relevant for the Saarland from its perspective as a
          federal state but also in the global context. The Saarland was one of the first Länder to show in its strategy which of the global sustainability goals adopted
          under the 2030 Agenda are particularly relevant for the Land and what aspects require more attention.

          project approaches for implementing the Sustainable Development Strategy. Under the motto "Wir gestalten gemeinsam. Saarland nachhaltig" (Jointly shaping a
          sustainable Saarland), all interested an committed citizens and stakeholders in society were invited to network and get into dialogue and thus play an active
          part in the updating process. In this context, a team of sustainability experts selected ten flagship projects for a more sustainable Saarland from 80 proposals
          submitted and the process of successful implementation was started jointly. The continuous development of sustainability is both the basis and the mission of Saarland's
