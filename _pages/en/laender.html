    <p>In addition to the Federal Government, the majority of the Länder have their own strategy for sustainable development.
      Some Länder governments have aligned their strategies with the Global Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda,
      while efforts are being made by other Länder to adjust or draw up their own sustainable development strategy. Please note that most of the
      linked documents and webpages are available in German only.
