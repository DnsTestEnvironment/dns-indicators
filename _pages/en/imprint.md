## General copyright

The following applies to all standard publications of the Federal Statistical Office, either in printed or electronic form, and for the content of this website, including charts and downloadable products, unless additional or other information is given on the product/web page itself.

© Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis), 2022 <br>
Reproduction and distribution, also of parts, are permitted provided that the source is mentioned.

This applies to any redistribution of texts, data and charts by third parties where the Federal Statistical Office is the copyright owner and holds exclusive publishing rights. Re-use is permitted both for commercial and non-commercial purposes. There are also no restrictions on distribution by electronic means, via the internet or in printed form. No express authorisation is required from the Federal Statistical Office. It is, however, required to provide a source note. Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis) shall be named as the publisher in the list of references.

Amendments, deletions/abridgements or omissions, redesigns or other modifications shall be identified as such, or a note shall be included in the references stating that the data have been changed, have only been used as the basis for calculation or have been presented in a different form.

Excluded from the temporally and geographically unlimited scope of use are the usage rights of third parties which are explicitly set out in our publications or on our web pages (e.g. photo rights). This also applies to jointly-issued products. There is no general policy here. Each product must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

It is therefore recommended that, when exploiting our data, users ensure that the copyright information is included in the product in question and, if necessary, that they contact the copyright owners given in the Legal Notice.
