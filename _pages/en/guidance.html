<h3>Open source project on GitHub</h3>
The online platforms are publicly accessible tools for the dissemination and presentation of data on national and global sustainability indicators.
The online platforms were developed in accordance with recognised and international guidelines, in particular with regard to freely accessible data and software.

<h3>Sources</h3>

The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) actively supports the development of national online platforms, in particular as open source solutions
for the presentation of sustainability indicators. Pioneers in this area are the USA and Great Britain.
The project code for the national and for the global online platform is publicly available in the following GitHub repositories:

<br><br>
A universal version of the code for an online platform developed by the United States, Great Britain and the Center for Open Data Enterprise is
available. The german online platforms are based on this code. If you are interested, we recommend that you familiarise yourself with the SDG online
platforms of the United States and Great Britain and the relevant <a href="https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blanc" onclick="return confirm_alert('open-sdg', 'En');">Open SDG project documentation</a>.
