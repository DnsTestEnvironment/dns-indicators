<h3 class="h3bold">1. How often is the data updated?</h3>
The frequency with which new data is published and the time at which this happens varies for many indicators.
As soon as new data is available for an indicator or previously published data is corrected, this data is also
published on this online platform. The platform is usually updated once a month. You can see when the last update
took place on the start page next to the button for downloading the data.

<h3 class="h3bold">2. How can I suggest new or different data sources?</h3>
For feedback on the data sources we use or for suggestions for new data sources, please contact us here: <a href="mailto:{{site.email_contacts.questions}}">{{site.email_contacts.questions}}</a>

<h3 class="h3bold">3. What is the meaning of the weather symbols?</h3>
All indicators in the DNS have specific targets that are to be achieved either annually or at a certain point in the future. The weather symbols are intended to give an impression of how an indicator is performing in relation to the respective target. A detailed description of how this assessment is carried out and what the weather symbols mean in detail can be found <a href="https://dnstestenvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/en/status/">here</a>.

<h3 class="h3bold">4. Why is there not a weather symbol for every indicator?</h3>
When assessing the indicators with regard to their target achievement, not only a momentary snapshot is considered, but also the development of previous years. However, there are not enough data points available for some indicators, meaning that no assessment can be made in these cases.  For some other indicators, the comparability of the data over time is limited (e.g. due to methodological changes in data collection), meaning that no reliable statement can be made on target achievement.

<h3 class="h3bold">5. The texts and weather symbols for some indicators do not refer to the most recent reporting year. Why is this the case?</h3>
The Federal Statistical Office's reporting on the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy provides for the publication of a comprehensive indicator report every two years. Since 2020, the data on the indicators has also been published on this platform. While the data on the platform is continuously updated, the texts and weather symbols cannot be constantly revised, as they are created in close consultation between the Federal Statistical Office and the responsible ministries. They therefore correspond to the status of the latest indicator report and may therefore refer to an older status in comparison to the data.

<h3 class="h3bold">6. What is disaggregation?</h3>
Disaggregation is used to divide an existing indicator into further subcategories for more detailed analysis. The best known are age or gender. However, separate disaggregations apply to many indicators.

<h3 class="h3bold">7. Can other countries copy this website?</h3>
The website can be used freely to create your own online platform. The terms and conditions for the use of GitHub apply. Further information can be found at <a href="https://dnstestenvironment.github.io/dns-indicators/en/help/guidance/">Technical guidance</a>.
